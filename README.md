This repository will contain all the data science or deep learning/machine learning projects' repositories that I created while learning concepts from different youtube channels. 

The purpose of creating this repo was to document the efforts I took for honing my skills in data science, and also to showcase and explain any recruiter the code and the logic/maths behind the projects that will be added subsequently in this repo.
